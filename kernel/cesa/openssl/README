OpenSSL
===========
 In order to explore the Orion CESA through the OpenSSL, you have to use the 
 OpenSSL OCF cryptodev engine.By default the cryptodev engine will use the CESA 
 accelerator.

 o On the Orion FS create a crypto dev: mknod /dev/crypto c 10 70
 o download openssl-0.9.8e (http://www.openssl.org/), then untar+unzip it.
 o apply the patches (in the following order):
  - ssl.patch - a patch from OCF for the OpenSSL cryptodev.
 o copy from kernel crypto/ocf/cryptodev.h to FS /usr/include/crypto .
 o Run: ./config --with-cryptodev
 o and compile ...('make' and 'make install')
 o After compilation finished copy libssl.so.0.9.8(from openssl root directory)
   to /lib and rename it to libssl.so.6 .
 o Copy libcrypto.so.0.9.8(from openssl root directory)to /lib and rename it 
   to libcrypto.so.6 .    

 you can run a speed test to make sure everything is working:
	openssl speed -evp des3 -elapsed 
 Modify /dev/crypto to /dev/crypto_tmp so that the speed test will use
 now software encryption.
 Run again:
        openssl speed -evp des3 -elapsed
 Compare results.
