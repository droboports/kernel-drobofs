   
    How to build and install the linux driver for Marvell SATA controller.


1. Introduction
---------------

    This is the partial linux kernel driver source code for Marvell SATA 
controllers. Current version of the source only supports 2.6 kernel.


2. Build
--------

    2.1 Make sure kernel source/headers is ready.

        Depending on your need, you may want to build a driver for the running
    kernel of your host machine, or you might want to build drivers for other
    versions of kernel. In both cases, you should have the source code of the 
    kernel installed. For example, you should launch yast and install the
    'kernel-source' package if you're using SuSE Linux (including SLED/SLES ).

	To build the module, you also should know where the kernel source is. 
    For SuSE Linux and Red Hat, the source to the running kernel can be found
    at /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build. If you want to build driver for a 
    customized kernel, make sure your user account have the access to the 
    source. 

    2.2 Build the driver

	If you're building driver for a kernel other than the running one, you
    should let driver source know the path to the kernel source before issuing
    make. You have two ways of issuing make command:

       	    1)  Set the shell environment variable 'KERNEL_SRC' to the 
            path to kernel source for which you want to build the driver. 
            Suppose the source is located at /usr/src/linux, then execute the 
            following command:
		
	        $ export KERNEL_SRC=/usr/src/linux
	        $ make
        
	    2) Specify the KERNEL_SRC in the invocation of make command:

		$ make KERNEL_SRC=/usr/src/linux

    	Watching the sources being compiled, and when it stops, you're done.

	Note : Make sure the kernel source is properly prepared for external
    module building. Execute 'make modules_prepare' in the kernel source 
    directory if you haven't done so.
	
    2.3 Install the driver.

        The module is named as mv61xx.ko. To install the driver, you type:
	
	    # insmod mv61xx.ko
	
	Note that you should be root when installing the module.


3. Build the driver into kernel
-------------------------------

    3.1 Make sure you have the complete kernel source installed.

	To patch a kernel tree, you'll need the complete source to the linux
    kernel. Also you'll need to verify that you have the write permission on
    the source directory.


    3.2 Patch the source.

        Change working directory to the thor source code, type:*
	
	    # make KERNEL_SRC=/usr/src/linux kbuild

	You should substitute '/usr/src/linux' with the absolute path to 
	the kernel source directory.

	You can always rewind the patch by using the following command:
		
   	    # make KERNEL_SRC=/usr/src/linux ukbuild
	
    3.3 Build the kernel

	Now you could start kernel configuration process, using any method
    you like ( e.g. 'make menuconfig' ). The option to build thor driver is
    under 'Device Drivers'->'SCSI device support'->'SCSI low-level drivers'->
    'Marvell Storage Controller 6121/6122/6141/6145'. Highlight that option 
    and press 'Y', then thor driver will be built into kernel image. Note that
    thor driver depends on SCSI and SCSI disk support, so you should also build
    them as part of the kernel ( not as modules ).

	You can then follow the normal kernel building process, which varies
    on different linux distributions and is not covered here.


4. Note
-------

* We've tested the patch successfully against kernel 2.6.16 and upward.
